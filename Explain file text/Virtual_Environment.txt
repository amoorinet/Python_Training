Some times need Requirements before Create or activate python virtual enviroment
# operation system is Windows 11 
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
cd "C:\Python\BARAA\Python_Barra\python scripts"

# Explaination

1- Execution Policy → In Windows PowerShell, this controls whether scripts are allowed to 
run (for security).
2- RemoteSigned → This level means:

    A- Scripts written on your computer can run without restriction.

    B- Scripts downloaded from the internet must be signed by a trusted publisher
3- Scope Process → This applies only to the current PowerShell session (once you close the 
window, it resets).

# Conclusion

So basically, you’re saying:
👉 “For this PowerShell window, allow me to run my local scripts without restriction, but 
keep some security checks for downloaded scripts.

⚡ Why needed for virtual environment

When you create or activate a Python virtual environment (venv), PowerShell runs a small script called Activate.ps1.

By default, Windows blocks running .ps1 scripts for security.

That’s why you sometimes see errors like “running scripts is disabled on this system”.

To fix this temporarily, you run:

Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process


This tells PowerShell:
✅ “Let me run activation scripts (Activate.ps1) just for this session.”

📝 Notes

You don’t always need it — only if PowerShell blocks your venv activation.

It’s safe when used with -Scope Process because it applies only to your current 
PowerShell window, not system-wide.

How Create and activate virtual enviroment 

1- Go to your project folder 

cd "C:\Python\BARAA\Python_Barra\python scripts\Copilot\Python_Training"

2- Create a virtual environment

python -m venv venv

    A- This creates a new folder called venv inside your project.
    B-It contains its own Python interpreter and libraries
     (separate from your system Python).

3: Activate the virtual environment

.\venv\Scripts\Activate
After activation, you should see (venv) at the start of your prompt, like:

(venv) PS C:\Python\BARAA\Python_Barra\python scripts\Copilot\Python_Training>

(venv) with different color

now you’re working inside your isolated Python environment

4- Deactivate (when done)

To go back to your global Python:

deactivate

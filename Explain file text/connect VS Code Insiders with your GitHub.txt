0) Prereqs (one time)

Install Git → run in terminal to check:
git --version

Sign in GitHub in VS Code Insiders
Bottom-left Accounts → Sign in to GitHub → Authorize.

1) Clone your repo (recommended path)

VS Code Insiders → Ctrl+Shift+P → Git: Clone

Paste your repo URL (use the one ending with .git):

https://github.com/amoorinet/trraning.git


Pick a local folder → when prompted, choose Open (so this window is focused on the repo).

2) Set your Git identity (authorship on commits)

(Do once on your machine; use your preferred email—real or GitHub noreply)

git config --global user.name "amoorinet"
git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"


Tip: If you prefer privacy, set your GitHub noreply email from GitHub Settings → Emails, then use it here.

3) Bring your existing files into the repo

In File Explorer, copy your Python files from your current folder
(e.g. C:\Python\BARAA\Python_Barra\python scripts\...)

Paste them inside the cloned trraning folder.

4) Add a Python .gitignore (so venv, cache, etc. don’t get committed)

Create a file named .gitignore in the repo with:

# Python
__pycache__/
*.pyc
*.pyo
*.pyd
.env
.venv
venv/
ENV/
env/
*.egg-info/
dist/
build/

# VS Code
.vscode/

# OS junk
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db

5) First commit & push (GUI in VS Code)

Open Source Control (branch icon).

Click + at the top to Stage All (you don’t need to stage files one by one).

Message: first commit: add training scripts → Commit (✓).

Click Push (↑).

This sends all staged+committed changes to GitHub in one go.

6) Verify

Open your repo page in the browser:
https://github.com/amoorinet/trraning
You should see your files.

Daily workflow (cheat sheet)

Pull latest: Source Control … menu → Pull (or git pull)

Stage all: click + at top (or git add .)

Commit: write a message → ✓ (or git commit -m "message")

Push: ↑ (or git push)

You can stage many files at once and commit once with a single message—no need to repeat step 4 per file.

Alternative: connect an existing local folder to GitHub (if you didn’t clone)

If you already have a folder that should become the repo:

cd "C:\Path\To\Your\Existing\Folder"
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/amoorinet/trraning.git
git push -u origin main


Then open that folder in VS Code Insiders and continue normally.

Virtual environment note (so your repo stays clean)

Create/activate venv inside the repo if you like:
python -m venv venv → .\venv\Scripts\activate

Keep venv/ out of Git (the .gitignore above already excludes it).
